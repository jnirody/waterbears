An overview of all the codes, how to run them, and their outputs.

----

Before anything else, run: 'write_final_csvs_top.py'

This outputs 
- an averaged csv file: 'bear_averages.csv'
- a compiled frame-by-frame csv for all bears: 'compiled_bears_by_frames.csv'
- a set of frame-by-frame csvs
- a set of stride-by-stride csvs
